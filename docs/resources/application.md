# Pacticipant Resource

This resource manages the lifecycle of a _Application_ (also known as a pacticipant). An Application may perform the role of a consumer or a provider in the Pact ecosystem.

## Compatibility

-> This feature is available to both PactFlow and OSS users

## Example Usage

The following examples show the basic usage of the resource.

```hcl
resource "pact_application" "admin" {
  name = "AdminService"
  repository_url = "github.com/company/admin"
}
```

-> Thisresource was renamed in order to simplify our language of core Pact concepts in the ecosystem. It is still available under its previous name `pact_pacticipant` for compatibility reasons.

The following arguments are supported:

- `name` - (Required, string) The name of the application.
